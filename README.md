# TalkAndPlay
Talk and Play is a system that allows people with disabilities to:

- communicate with their environment
- be more independent during their leisure time
- receive training and exercise for rehabilitation at home, under the guidance of their therapist.

This way, they will be able to communicate, listen to music, watch movies and train for a quicker rehabilitation.

The project is being developed by SciFY with the exclusive donation from [Stavros Niarchos Foundation](http://www.snf.org/en/).
