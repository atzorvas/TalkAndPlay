# TalkAndPlay
Talk and Play is a system that allows people with disabilities to:

-communicate with their environment
-be more independent during their leisure time
-receive training and exercise for rehabilitation at home, under the guidance of their therapist.

This way, they will be able to communicate, listen to music, watch movies and train for a quicker rehabilitation.
